# Can adding an audible signal showing the position of escape route signs get passengers to an exit faster? 


## Motivation

Signal presentation on multiple channels
In other context e.g. airplane cockpits faster detection of warnings by visual & audio cue [3]

- Transfer to escape route indication?
- Faster detection by adding audio indication to the exiting signs
- Finding the way faster?
- Finding the closest exit?
