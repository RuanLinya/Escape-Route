# Can adding an audible signal showing the position of escape route signs get passengers to an exit faster? 


## Motivation

Signal presentation on multiple channels
In other context e.g. airplane cockpits faster detection of warnings by visual & audio cue [3]

- Transfer to escape route indication?
- Faster detection by adding audio indication to the exiting signs
- Finding the way faster?
- Finding the closest exit?


##  Hypotheses
1.The average escape time is shorter if the escape route signs are equipped with an audio signal indicating the position of the signs.

2.The number of participants which use the closest escape route is higher if the escape route signs are equipped with an audio signal indicating the position of the signs.


##  Variables
-Independent Variable	

escape route sign indication

(1) visual escape route signs only 
(2) visual escape route signs with audio signal indicating their position

- Dependent Variables  
average escape time [seconds]
took the closest exit [boolean]

- Statistics
between-subject design  
independent samples T-test

## Implementation!
- Software

Unity 2020.3.3f1

- Hardware

HTC VIVE Pro with controllers
locomotion by arm-swinging method
standardised testing room
standing only play-area
looking around via head movement

- VR-Setting
office building with 4 emergency exits 

escape route sign point to closest exit

- Cover Story

Participants enter through an exit that is not the closest exit 
Test the arm-swinging method for locomotion in VR
First get familiar then test it in a real life scenario
