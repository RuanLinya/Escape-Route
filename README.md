# Can adding an audible signal showing the position of escape route signs get passengers to an exit faster? 
â€¢Created a virtual conflagration scenario using Unity 3D and VR Vive

Signal presentation on multiple channels
In other context e.g. airplane cockpits faster detection of warnings by visual & audio cue [3]

Transfer to escape route indication?
Faster detection by adding audio indication to the exiting signs
Finding the way faster?
Finding the closest exit?
